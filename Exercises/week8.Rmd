```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

1. Run your week 7 R code to get the data frame `hivlong`.
Reduce `hivlong` to the years 1990 to 2000, inclusive.

2. Write a function `hivregr()` that takes data for a single
country, fits a least squares regression of `prevalence` on `year`
and returns the estimated regression slope.


3. Split the `hivlong` data frame on `Country` and
use `map_dbl()` to apply `hivregr()` to the data from 
each country. Save the results in a vector `slopes`.
Print the countries with estimated slope greater than one.

4. Repeat part, but instead of defining a function `hivregr()`
outside `map_dbl()`, define the function within the call to 
`map_dbl()` and use all available short-cuts.
