# Databases

## Relational database

- A relational database is a collection of 
tables. 
    - As statisticians, we think of rows 
    (a.k.a. records) as 
    sampled units, and columns as the variables
    measured on the units.
- Rows of one table are related to rows of 
others by keys
    - Each table has a key (primary key) that 
    uniquely identifies the rows.
    - Including the key of another table 
    (a foreign key)
    allows us to link (relate) records of 
    the two tables.
    
    
## Simple example database

\footnotesize

Example from [http://www.itl.nist.gov/div897/ctg/dm/sql_examples.htm]

- `STATION` table (ID is primary key)

ID  | City    | State  | Lat_N  | Long_W
--- | ------- | ------ | ------ | -------
13  | Phoenix | AZ     | 33     | 112
44  | Denver  | CO     | 40     | 105
66  | Caribou | ME     | 47     | 68

- `STATS` table (primary key suppressed; ID is 
foreign key)

ID  | Month | Temp_F | Rain_I
--- | ----- | ------ | ------
13  | 1     | 57.4   | 0.31
13  | 7     | 91.7   | 5.15
44  | 1     | 27.3   | 0.18
44  | 7     | 74.8   | 2.11
66  | 1     | 6.7    | 2.1
66  | 7     | 65.8   | 4.52

## Database software terminology

- Software refered to as relational database 
management systems (RDBMS).
    - Example implementations: MySQL, SQLite
- The language for querying the database is 
structured query language (SQL).
    - Similar implementations in all major RDBMS
- The database resides on a server, which
we access with a client.
    - Large databases will be on special-purpose
    remote servers.
    - Client runs on your computer.
    - However, client/server model usually
    involves layers of security
    that make access difficult.
    - We'll work mostly with SQLite, for which the server
    runs on your computer.
 
## Why databases in R?

- The data is stored in a RDBMS.
    - Our focus today
- Work with datasets that are too large to be 
stored in memory
    
## SQLite databases in R 

\small

- The `RSQLite` package contains an SQLite client
_and_ server we can use from R
    - SQLite is an open-source RDBMS engine bundled
    with RSQLite
    - Interface 
    with DB engine (connect, write to, etc.) _via_ 
    a common interface called `DBI`
    - Install `RSQLite` and `DBI` before starting
    - Load `DBI`; access functions from `RSQLite`
    with the `::` operator.
```{r}
library(DBI)
mydb <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "my-db.sqlite")
dbDisconnect(mydb)
#> [1] TRUE
unlink("my-db.sqlite")
```

## Notes

- The first line, 
`mydb <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "my-db.sqlite")`,
creates a "connection" to an SQLite database stored in the file "my-db.sqlite"
    - `SQLite()` is called the "driver". It 
    handles all the RDBMS-specific details of
    how the client and server communicate.
    - The following argument is the file name for the 
    database. Other drivers need details like
    username and password to connect.
    - Initially the database is empty
- The second line, `dbDisconnect(mydb)`,
disconnects from the database, but does not
remove it.
- Remove with `unlink()` (a base R command).
- `dbDisconnect()` and all other commands
we will use of the 
form `db*` are generics from `DBI`

## Aside: MySQL database driver in R

- Wasn't able to get easy access to a MySQL database
on campus. 
- In case it is of later use, here are the arguments
to `dbConnec()` for connecting to a password-protected
database for Stat 341.

\footnotesize

```
con <- dbConnect(MySQL(), user='stataccess', 
                  password='<password goes here>', 
                  dbname='stat341', 
                  host='muncho.its.sfu.ca')
dbListTables(con)
```
## Creating `STATION` and `STATS` tables

\scriptsize

```{r}
wdb <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "wdb.sqlite")
STATION <- data.frame(ID=c(13,44,66),
    City = c("Phoenix","Denver","Caribou"),
    State = c("AZ","CO","ME"),
    Lat_N = c(33,40,47),
    Long_W = c(112,105,68))
STATS <- data.frame(row = 1:6,
    ID = c(13,13,44,44,66,66),
    Month = c(1,7,1,7,1,7),
    Temp_F = c(57.4,91.7,27.3,74.8,6.7,65.8),
    Rain_I = c(0.31,5.15,0.18,2.11,2.1,4.52))
dbWriteTable(wdb,name='STATION', value = STATION, overwrite=TRUE) 
dbWriteTable(wdb,name='STATS', value = STATS, overwrite=TRUE)
dbListTables(wdb)
```

## Notes

- The `overwrite=TRUE` argument to the 
`dbWriteTable()` commands is necessary for
this demo, to allow re-knitting the document,
but is not necessary in general.
- Now that we have an example database,
we can see how to use SQL to extract data.
- Will interleave SQL tutorial and `DBI`. 

## SQL: Retrieve data from a single table



- The SQL `SELECT` statements:
    - `SELECT * FROM STATION;`
    - `SELECT City, Lat_N FROM STATION;`
    - `SELECT Month, Temp_F, Rain_I FROM STATS;`
- Filtering with the `WHERE` clause:
    - `SELECT * from STATION WHERE Lat_N >= 40;`
- Most SQL interfaces require a `;` at the end of each statement, but not
R `DBI`.

## DBI: Example data retrieval.

\scriptsize

```{r}
dbGetQuery(wdb,"SELECT * from STATION")
dbGetQuery(wdb,"SELECT City, Lat_N from STATION")
dbGetQuery(wdb,"SELECT * from STATION WHERE Lat_N>=40")
```

## DBI: Notes on `dbGetQuery()`

- `dbGetQuery()` calls three functions: 
    (i) `dbSendQuery()` sends the query to the DB, 
    (ii) `dbFetch()` fetches the "result set", and 
    (iii) `dbClearResult()` frees memory and 
    other resources associated with the result set.
- If the result set is too large to fit in memory,
you can split the fetching into batches.
    * Then need to call `dbSendQuery()`, `dbFetch()` and `dbClearResult()`
    yourself.

## DBI: Batched queries 

\footnotesize

```{r}
rs <- dbSendQuery(wdb,"SELECT * FROM STATS")
while (!dbHasCompleted(rs)) {
  df <- dbFetch(rs, n = 2) # use n to set size of subset
  print(df)
}
dbClearResult(rs)
```

## DBI: Parametrized queries

\footnotesize

- Can pass the same query with several different
values of a parameter `x`.
    - Create a parameter in an SQL statement with `:<name>`
    - Bind a value to the parameter with `dbBind()`
    
```{r}
rs <- dbSendQuery(wdb,"SELECT * FROM STATION WHERE Lat_N >= :x")
dbBind(rs,param = list(x=40))
dbFetch(rs)
dbBind(rs,param=list(x=45))
dbFetch(rs)
dbClearResult(rs)
```


## SQL: Joining tables

\small

- The purpose of related tables is to 
reduce redundancy.
    - For example, all the info on the stations
    appears once in the `STATION` table, and 
    need not be repeated in the `STATS` table.
- But what if we need the info on the stations
and the weather data? Need to "join" tables.
- Simplest join (inner join):
`SELECT * from STATION, STATS WHERE STATION.ID=STATS.ID`

## DBI: Example joins

\scriptsize

```{r}
dbGetQuery(wdb,"SELECT * from STATION, STATS WHERE STATION.ID=STATS.ID")
queryp1 <- "SELECT City, State, Month, Rain_I from STATION, STATS"
queryp2 <- "WHERE STATION.ID=STATS.ID AND Month = 1 AND Lat_N >= 40"
dbGetQuery(wdb,paste(queryp1,queryp2))
```

## SQL: Left joins

\small

- The inner join returns data for cities
in **both** the `STATION` and `STATS` tables.
- If we want the union of all stations, use
a left join.
    - First add another station with no data in `STATS`
    - Miami, FL is at Lat 26 and Long 80.
    - Give Miami station ID 77.
    - In SQL we'd add Miami and do the left join with 
```
INSERT INTO STATION VALUE (77,'Miami','FL',26,80)
SELECT * FROM STATION 
LEFT JOIN STATS ON STATION.ID = STATS.ID
```

- Many other types of SQL joins. See
[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_using_joins.htm]
for a summary of joins in SQLite.

## DBI: Adding to a table and left join

\footnotesize

```{r}
miami <- data.frame(ID=77,City="Miami",State="FL",Lat_N=26,Long_W=80)
dbWriteTable(wdb,name='STATION', value = miami, append=TRUE)
qq<-"SELECT * FROM STATION LEFT JOIN STATS ON STATION.ID = STATS.ID"
dbGetQuery(wdb,qq)
```

- Note: `append=TRUE` adds to the current table

## SQL: Table indices

\small

- A query like
`SELECT * FROM STATION WHERE Lat_N >= 40`
requires that the RDBMS read the `Lat_N` 
value in every row of `STATION` and 
return the rows where `Lat_N` is 40 or more
- Such a query can be made much faster 
by creating an "index" on `Lat_N`.
    - An index is a table in the database, sorted
    on the indexed variable.
    - See [http://www.sqlite.org/queryplanner.html] for
    a nice description of how indexing columns speeds
    up searches.
    
## DBI: Create an index with `dbExecute()`

\small

- Use `dbExecute()` to execute queries that
do not return tabular data.

```{r}
dbExecute(wdb,"CREATE INDEX indx ON STATION(Lat_N)")
```


## Exercises for Reading Week


1. Select the stations from the state of Colorado
2. Add Vancouver as 
a new station in the `STATION` table
(Use BC as the "State" and the latitude 49 and
longitude 123)
3. Do an inner join that returns a table with city,
state, and temperatures for July from 
cities at north latitude 40 or less.
4. Repeat (3) as a left join. 

## More Exercises

\scriptsize

5. Do a left join that returns a table with city,
state, and temperatures for July from 
cities at north latitude 40 or more.
(Vancouver excluded because
we filter on month, and month is missing for Vancouver.)
6. Do a left join that returns a table with city,
state, and temperatures from 
cities at north latitude 40 or less.

```{r}
vancouver <- data.frame(ID=88,City="Vancouver",State="BC",Lat_N=49,Long_W=123)
dbWriteTable(wdb,name='STATION', value = vancouver, append=TRUE)
qq1<-"SELECT City, State, Temp_F FROM STATION"
qq2<-"LEFT JOIN STATS ON STATION.ID = STATS.ID WHERE Lat_N >= 40"
dbGetQuery(wdb,paste(qq1,qq2))
```

## Clean up

```{r}
dbDisconnect(wdb)
unlink("wdb.sqlite")
```


# Merging, selecting and filtering on data frames

## Inner join data frames with `merge()` 

\footnotesize

- The `merge()` function in R does 
SQL-like joins on data frames.
    
```{r}
STATION <- rbind(STATION,miami)
merge(STATION,STATS,by="ID")
```

## Left joining data frames with `merge()` 

\footnotesize

```{r}
merge(STATION,STATS,by="ID",all.x=TRUE)
```

## Join functions in `dplyr`

\footnotesize

- In `dplyr` the functions for joining are
more explicitly named

```{r, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
inner_join(STATION,STATS,by="ID")
```


## Left join function in `dplyr`

\footnotesize

```{r}
left_join(STATION,STATS,by="ID")
```

## `select()` to select columns

\footnotesize

- `select()` from `dplyr` can be used to select columns.
    - Can use different "helper" functions to select variables
    (`help(select_helpers))`
    
\scriptsize

```{r}
select(STATION,City,State)
select(STATION,matches("L."))
```

## Using `filter()` like `WHERE`

```{r}
select(STATION,matches("L.")) %>% filter(Lat_N>=40)
```


## Combining join/select/filter with `%>%`

```{r}
inner_join(STATION,STATS,by="ID") %>% 
  select(matches("._.")) %>% filter(Lat_N>=40)
```


## Exercises with `dplyr`

1. Select the stations from the state of Colorado
(`filter()`)
2. Select the City and State from the stations
using the `select()` command from `dplyr`:
`select(STATION,City,State)`
3. Add Vancouver as 
a new station in the `STATION` data frame.
Use BC as the "State" and the latitude 49 and
longitude 123. (`rbind()` or `bind_rows()`)
4. Do an inner join that returns a table with city,
state, and temperatures for July from 
cities at north latitude 40 or less.
(`inner_join()` and `select()`)
5. Repeat (3) as a left join.
(`left_join()` and `select()`)
